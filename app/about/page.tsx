          My name is Danis Ram√≠rez, I was born in 1989. From the very beginning, when I was but a child, my mind was already wandering through realms of "philosophical" musings on the nature of being and existence, an intrinsic part of my consciousness that has lingered with me throughout my life and will, I suppose, remain a steadfast companion until the final day of my existence. I hated school and high school, but I found enjoyment in reading philosophy and history. I study Physics, and eventually taught for five years at the same university from which I graduated. I believed, or more fittingly, led myself to believe, that my life should traverse exotic paths, the kind that lead to barren landscapes and distant horizons, devoid of destination, and now, with a wry sense of reflection, I find myself pondering whether a touch less conviction might have served me better. I find myself far from the place I was born; sometimes I feel a yearning to return, while other times I am seized by the desire to venture even further away.
